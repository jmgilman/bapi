# Amazon S3 Configuration

The API can be configured to automatically download the contents of an S3 bucket
before starting. This allows fetching the contents of a ledger to the local
working directory of the container in lieue of mounting it directly. By default
the entire contents of the S3 bucket will be downloaded to the working
directory.

The API uses the `boto3` Python package for connecting to S3. It can load
authentication data from various sources, see the [docs][1]for more details.

## Configuration

To enable S3 integration set the following environment variable:

```shell
export BAPI_STORAGE="s3"
```

Additionally, you'll need to instruct the API which bucket to use:

```shell
export BAPI_S3__BUCKET="my-bucket"
```

Assuming authentication has been configured correctly, the API will
automatically fetch the entire contents of the S3 bucket to the configured
`BAPI_WORK_DIR` folder. Ensure that you update the entrypoint to the location of
the main ledger file:

```shell
export BAPI_ENTRYPOINT="main.beancount"
```
